## Usage

This library provides various base interfaces, which are the building block for functional Java applications.

While many of these exist in the most recent versions of Java, older versions of Java did not include them, so this library is ideal 
for developing backwards-compatible Java code. This is especially useful when developing GWT applications.

Find the interfaces and classes for this library [here](http://modules.appjangle.com/delight-functional/latest/apidocs/delight/functional/package-summary.html).
